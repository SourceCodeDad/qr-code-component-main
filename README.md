Hello! My name is Roque Rodriguez. Thank you for visiting this beginner project that I am pretty proud of :).

This project is a simple QR component card. I created this project using HTML and CSS. 

I did my very best at maintaining responsiveness for both Mobile and Desktop users.

The biggest accomplishment for me while completing this project was finally learning how to center an element horizontally AND vertically using flex-box. This was something that I always had trouble grasping.. I learned that its important to wrap the content you want to center within a "main container"

This project is a challenge you can find on frontendmentor.com

Any and all feedback is welcome!

Thank you!!!
